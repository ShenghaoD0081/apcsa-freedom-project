### Struggles
This time I had less progress tan before because I was really confused about what I wanted to make. I have said I wanted to make a RPG game but that is still really broad and doesn't help me much with thinking up ideas. Game Development was way more difficult than I thought as you have to work on things such than coding such as the sprites and tilemap which I have yet to learn how to make yet. This forces me to have to rethink about what I want to focus on and utilize my time more efficiently because what I am doing right now won't get me anywhere.

### Next plans
I plan to take things step by step this time. I already got the basic movement of my character down which was quite simple because it is a 2D game. Next I want to focus on AI Pathfinding so enemies will actually target the player. For this I will be using the [A* Pathfinding](https://arongranberg.com/astar/) project. A* Pathfinding is a very powerful tool that allows me to implement pathfinding easily which means I can move onto my next steps quicker than anticipated which is perfect. I do want to program my own pathfinding algorithm if I have time but I will use this in the mean time. After that I want to focus on HP bars and damaging enemies/taking damage. I think focusing on things one by one would be great. For my current focus, pathfinding, I need to make a tilemap in order to create obstacles that the enemy has to navigate and get to me as well as a a radius that the enemy can see the playe rin so the player doesn't get chased forever. 

### Goals
My current goal is to finish my MVP (Minimal Viable Project) by April and use May and June to fine tune the game by optimizing the code and adding things beyond the MVP. Knowing me, I know it's going to be a hard process and it's very likely that it won't even happen so I will have to be stricter on myself when deciding work dates for this project.
