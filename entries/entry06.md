### Content

After we finished our products we had to present them to judges. In order to do that I had to create an **elevator pitch**. It wasn't easy doing that since I wasn't used to giving fast explanations of my project. I felt like I rushed too much and did not give as much important information about the project as I should have. Next time, I want to make sure my elevator pitch is more thought out and captures the meaning of my project more. We also created a **presentation** after that as well. This time I had to present to my peers about my project. I believe I did fine on the presentation however I need to make sure to ease into the ending of the presentation since mine ended very abruptly. Another thing I want to do is to make my slides more visually appearing since that is a important part of a presentation that I neglected. I also want to be able to speak more clearly since there are often times where I stuttered. When presentating about my project there was a need to show code snippets in order to explain how my project works however, I felt like my snippets were way too big and overwhelming so I will make smaller snippets next time so it's easier to read. I made many mistakes during both presentations but this will be a good learning experience for next time.
