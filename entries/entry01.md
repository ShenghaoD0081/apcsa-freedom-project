I have started tinkering and testing out things in Unity but I haven't started on creating my project yet. As of right now I'm still confused on
what exactly I want to create for this project. I have two ideas right now of what I want to make:a rhythm game, or a rpg. One thing I'm sure of is that I want a singleplayer 
game because a multiplayer game would be too ambitious and I don't believe I'll be able to achieve it. 

Currently I'm still in the researching phase of the Design Engineering Project. I still don't know much about Unity and C# so I will continue researching it. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on9nwbZngyw) helped me a lot while I was researching. The video didn't teach me anything about C# but it told me a lot about how Unity works 
and what I should think about when starting Unity. I also used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php) to look at soem C# code and I noticed that it is similar to code I've done before

```C# Snippet
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```
This code above is very similar to Javascript which I made a project on last year(You can find the project [here](https://github.com/ShenghaoD0081/sep11-freedom-project)).
This reminds me of console.log in Javascript which logs information onto the console.
```JS 
Console.log("Hello World!");
```
Now that I know that C# is similar to code I've done before, my next step is to continue researching and start coding. I want to start by writing something small first since this is a language I have never learned before. I also think it might be a good idea for me to just practice C# first and not use Unity to do it so I get the gist of it first. Then I can figure out how Unity helps enhance C# for this project.
